    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a emerging professional working on my HTML/CSS/Java script skills in order to become an experienced web page
      designer/developer for either front end or backend developement. As well as making sure to have clear
      communications
      with my team mates and program manger(s). I whenever in a group I try to empower others by giving them helpful
      ideas to
      create and then letting them build on those ideas. For instance I had a Professional essay due and I gave everyone
      a way
      to explain the topic question with their answers but along the way always asking for their input on certain ideas
      and
      seeing them kind of light up with ideas of how to go about the project was great since everyone collaborated
      consistanly
      because everyone was included.</p>

    <p>i am an experienced Computer Technician with a demonstrated history of working in the computer hardware industry.
      Skilled in Computer Hardware Diagnostics, HTML, javascript, java, C#, Python, and CSS. I have a total of 11 years
      of using Blender for 3D graphical
      art and still learning something new every day. Used Unity Engine for 1 year in game production as well as still
      learning all of it's quirks. Overall I have put myself in positions to learn on my own time considering I was
      always
      willing to learn something new and try to achieve one goal in mind, and that goal being to learn/grow. with this
      mindset
      I can never fail as long as I learn and grow from it.</p>
